# naturalis-icon-font
A webfont containing much used interface icons in Naturalis style.

Icon fonts are a flexible way for including icons in websites. Instead of using images for displaying 'iconographic' elements, we load specific font where the characters have been replaced by icons. This Naturalis icon font contains arrows, chevrons, magnifier glasses and many more elements adjusted to the Naturalis corporate style.

The main advantages of using an icon font are (quoting iconfont.com)
- flexible: change the color of your icons or apply other CSS effects.
- scalable: changing the size of your icons would be as easy as changing the font size.
- vector: Font icons are vector and resolution independent
- fast: By having your icons in a font, you can load them with one HTTP request.

Workflow:
- create SVG files
- convert SVG files to font
- load font into website
- use html and css to display them on your website.

The SVG files in this repro are created using Adobe Illustrator by saving every artboard to a SVG file. It's also possible to edit or adjust SVG files using Inkscape. But don't combine workflows, or you risk losing work when Adobe Illustrator overwrites your custom SVG files.
