# naturalis-icon-font
A webfont containing much used interface icons in Naturalis style.

Icon fonts are a flexible way for including icons in websites. Instead of using images for displaying 'iconographic' elements, we load specific font where the characters have been replaced by icons. This Naturalis icon font contains arrows, chevrons, magnifier glasses and many more elements adjusted to the Naturalis corporate style.

The main advantages of using an icon font are (quoting iconfont.com)
- flexible: change the color of your icons or apply other CSS effects.
- scalable: changing the size of your icons would be as easy as changing the font size.
- vector: Font icons are vector and resolution independent
- fast: By having your icons in a font, you can load them with one HTTP request.

== Creating and editing SVG files ==

The SVG files in this repro are created using Adobe Illustrator by saving every artboard to a SVG file. It's also possible to edit or adjust SVG files using Inkscape. But don't combine workflows, or you risk losing work when Adobe Illustrator overwrites your custom SVG files.

The SVG files are also contained in the JSON file. You can use this JSON file to quickly import the set into the icomoon app. After you made changes in this app, you can export the existing back into the JSON file.

== Using in websites ==

From the icomoon app, you can download the font. It also includes a sample HTML file and the proper CSS to copy-paste in your website.

You can use online recourses to convert and combine SVG files into a font, notably:
